- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrGeorgeBinns
- 👀 I’m interested in Entomology, evolution, behavioural ecology, systematics and conservation behaviour!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about honeybees and how we can use probiotics to increase their resistance to disease. And also how to use GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my Amata tiger moth research from my PhD - the entire Australian genus needs a systematic revision!
- 📫 How to reach me: email georgina.binns@mq.edu.au or georgina.e.binns@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: A male moth genital appendage is called an 'aedeagus'.
